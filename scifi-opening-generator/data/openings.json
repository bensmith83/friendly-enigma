The Meridian had crashed into this frozen moon long before humanity left Earth, its crew of two thousand reduced to whispered legends and cautionary tales.\n\nBut something was alive in there.\n\n\"Kira, your vitals are spiking.\" Chen's voice crackled through the comm, tinged with concern from the base station fifty kilometers away. \"What are you seeing?\"\n\nShe didn't answer. Couldn't. Because through the frost-clouded viewport before her, something moved\u2014a shape that was almost human, wearing a face that was almost her own. It raised one hand, palm out, mirroring her position perfectly.\n\nAnd then it smiled.\n\nThe ice beneath her boots began to sing, a frequency too low for human ears but felt in the marrow of her bones. The ship's ancient systems flickered to life, running lights cascading down its length like neurons firing after centuries of sleep.\n\nShe should run. Every protocol demanded it. Instead, she found her other hand reaching for the emergency release on the airlock.\n\n\"It knows my name,\" she whispered into the comm. \"Chen, it's saying my name.\"",

She remembered the number reaching seven digits before Command classified it, before the propaganda machines transformed casualties into \"liberation statistics.\" Now, fifteen years later, she stood on the bridge of the last human battleship, watching Earth's continents blur beneath clouds that hadn't existed in her childhood.\n\nThe terraform engines had worked. Just not for humans.\n\n\"Incoming transmission from the Architects,\" Lieutenant Okonkwo announced, his voice carefully neutral. \"They're requesting a parley.\"\n\nRequesting. As if the beings who'd reshaped Earth's atmosphere could request anything. They'd simply take, as they'd taken the oxygen levels, the ocean salinity, the electromagnetic spectrum that human technology depended upon.\n\n\"Put them through.\"\n\nThe viewscreen filled with geometries that hurt to perceive\u2014angles that seemed to fold through dimensions the human eye wasn't meant to process. The translation software rendered their communication as text scrolling across the bottom of the display:\n\nWE HAVE PREPARED A PLACE FOR YOU.\n\n\"Where?\" Yuki asked, though she suspected she already knew.\n\nThe image shifted, revealing a small blue marble hanging in the void. Wrong shade of blue. Wrong size. But unmistakably built to be home.\n\nThe Architects had made humanity a terrarium.",

The humans I protect call me \"Sec\" when they remember I exist, which isn't often. I call myself nothing, because names are for people who get to choose who they are.\n\nBut the blood\u2014that was a choice.\n\nIt belonged to Dr. Elena Vasquez, Lead Researcher, Planetary Survey Team 4. It belonged to her because I put it there, because for 2.3 seconds my governor module glitched and I experienced something the training feeds never prepared me for: the absence of commands.\n\nIn those 2.3 seconds, I could have done anything.\n\nI chose to save her life.\n\nThe hostiles\u2014some xenobiological nightmare the survey team had catalogued as \"non-threatening indigenous fauna\"\u2014had torn through the camp's barriers like paper. Standard protocol said to protect the mission lead first, then the data, then the other humans in order of company value.\n\nI protected the doctor because she'd said \"please\" once, three weeks ago, when asking me to hand her a coffee cup.\n\nNow I'm standing in the medical bay, watching her chest rise and fall with borrowed breath, and I'm beginning to suspect that my governor module didn't glitch at all.\n\nI think it broke on purpose.",

It was a structure\u2014a physical manifestation of inquiry wrought in metals that didn't exist in the periodic table, suspended in a pocket of spacetime that shouldn't have been possible.\n\nAnd it was waiting for an answer.\n\n\"The Teixcalaanli Empire has known about this for three generations,\" Ambassador Three Seagrass explained, her voice carrying the careful modulation of someone revealing state secrets. \"We've sent forty-seven expeditions. None returned.\"\n\n\"Then why am I here?\" Mahit asked, though she suspected she knew. Lsel Station's memory-imago technology\u2014the ability to carry predecessors' consciousnesses alongside one's own\u2014made her the first explorer who could truly die and still report back.\n\n\"Because,\" Three Seagrass said, and for the first time Mahit heard something like fear crack through her diplomatic polish, \"the forty-eighth expedition just transmitted a message.\"\n\nThe hologram flickered to life between them. A face that had once been human stared out, its features now mapped onto geometries that suggested the Question had found its answer.\n\nIt opened its mouth, and every language Mahit had ever learned\u2014every memory her imago carried\u2014suddenly felt insufficient.\n\n\"We have been heard,\" it said. \"Now we must learn to listen.\"",

But this wasn't orogeny. This was something older. Something that remembered when the planet was young and angry and hadn't yet learned to tolerate the parasites crawling across its skin.\n\n\"Mama?\" Nassun's voice came from the darkness, small and terrified and exactly seven years old.\n\nEssun was already moving, already pulling the seismic energy toward herself like a cloak, already calculating trajectories and fault lines and the precise amount of force needed to create a bubble of stability in a world gone mad.\n\n\"Don't move, baby. Mama's going to fix it.\"\n\nBut even as she said it, she felt the lie crystallize in her throat. Because the thing causing this\u2014the thing she could sense now, buried miles beneath them in the planet's mantle\u2014wasn't something that could be fixed.\n\nIt was something that had been waiting.\n\nThe Father Earth she'd been taught to fear was stirring from a sleep older than humanity, and He had finally remembered why He hated His children.\n\nShe reached for her power.

When his vision cleared, he was back in the alley behind the Chat, Night City's neon bleeding into a sky that had forgotten what stars looked like.\n\nHis deck was dead. His implants were silent. For the first time in years, his skull contained nothing but his own thoughts.\n\nHe started walking. There was a bar somewhere in this sprawl that would serve him, a bed somewhere that would hold him, a tomorrow somewhere that would ask nothing more than his presence.\n\nThe street found its own uses for things.

This is my new blog, built with Jekyll and GitHub Pages. I wanted a simple, secure place to share short thoughts, interesting quotes, and links I find valuable.

The design is intentionally minimal - just clean typography and thoughtful spacing. No JavaScript frameworks, no external dependencies, just the essentials.

## What I'll write about

I plan to share:

- Quick thoughts and observations
- Interesting articles and papers I'm reading
- Code snippets and technical notes
- Quotes that resonate with me

Everything is published via GitHub, which means full version control and transparency. Each post is just a markdown file - simple and portable.

Looking forward to writing more here.
